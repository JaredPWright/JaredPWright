- 👋 Hi, I’m @JaredPWright (AKA Bridgepin on most other socials)
- 👀 I’m interested in writing, cooking, and of course- PROGRAMMING!
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Computer Science with minors in English and DET (Digital Entertainment Technology) at Abilene Christian University.
      I am familiar with both C#, C++, and the barest working knowledge of Java and JS.
      I also have experience in both Maya and Blender, as well as Photoshop and a whole slew of other programs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game projects, or any work involving application programming. I am probably about level 4 in DnD 5e terms.
     I do learn quickly and enjoy good work.

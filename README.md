- 👋 Hi, I’m @JaredPWright (AKA Bridgepin on most other socials)
- 👀 I’m interested in writing and of course- PROGRAMMING!
- 🌱 I’m currently studying DET (Digital Entertainment Technology) at Abilene Christian University. Perhaps foolishly, I also have a second major in English and a minor            in CS.
      I am familiar with both C#, C++, and the barest working knowledge of Java and JS. I also have experience in both Maya and Blender, as well as Photoshop and a whole           slew of other programs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game projects, or any work involving application programming. I am probably about level 4 in DnD 5e terms. I do learn quickly
            and enjoy good work.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @JaredPWright
- 👀 I’m interested in writing, directing, and, of course- PROGRAMMING!
- 🌱 I’m currently studying DET (Digital Entertainment Technology) at Abilene Christian University with a second major in English and a minor in CS.
      I am familiar with both C# and C++. I also have experience in both Maya and Blender, as well as Photoshop and a whole slew of other programs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game projects, or any work involving application programming. I am a relative novice, but I do learn quickly
      and enjoy the work.
- 📫 You can reach me by:

      string[] Email(string[] email)
        {
          string[] MyReply;

          return MyReply.ASAP(); 
        }

        int[] Phone = new int[3];
        Phone[0] = 405;
        Phone[1] = 312;
        Phone[2]  = 0058;

        string discordHandle = FindObjectWithName("Bridgepin#" + 3365.ToString());
